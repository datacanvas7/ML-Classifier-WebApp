# ML Classifier Explorer

## 📘 Project Overview
The **ML Classifier Explorer** is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that allows users to explore and compare different machine learning classifiers on popular **scikit-learn** datasets.  
Users can dynamically choose between models like **KNN**, **SVM**, and **Random Forest**, tune their hyperparameters, and visualize classification performance in real time.

## 🧩 Libraries Used
- **streamlit** – for building the interactive web interface  
- **pandas** – for data handling  
- **numpy** – for numerical computations  
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** – for creating visualizations  
- **scikit-learn** – for datasets, model building, and evaluation

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Choose from three popular datasets: **Iris**, **Breast Cancer**, and **Wine**  
- Interactively select classifiers and tune their parameters via sidebar controls  
- View **accuracy scores** for each model instantly  
- Visualize dataset distributions using **PCA-based 2D scatter plots**  
- Option to display the underlying code for better understanding
